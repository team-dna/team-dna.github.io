                    <div class="12u">
                        <p>We spoke with Steffan and Dean from Immigration NZ about the Employer Accreditation process,
                            and discovered several pain points that affect both applicants and Immigration NZ.</p>
                        <h4>Paper Based</h4>
                        <p>Applications for Employer Accreditation are paper based. The paperwork must be transported by
                            mail between the employer and different Government offices around the country, handed over to
                            administration, and filed and ordered by staff. This results in unnecessary handling of applications
                            before they’ve been reviewed. </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="6u">
                        <h4>Resource Required</h4>
                        <p>The job of filling in an application or renewal is given to an HR employee, or sometimes a lawyer
                            or consultant. It requires considerable time to complete and thus is an opportunity cost. This cost
                            is a barrier to entry for many SMEs that would otherwise benefit from being accredited. </p>

                        <h4>Errors</h4>
                        <p>Many applications contain errors and must be returned (about 70% of first-time applications,
                            and 30% of renewals), further adding to the resource cost and time delay.</p>

                        <p>The status of a business’s application is not made visible to them:</p>
                        <ul style="margin: 1em">
                            <li>If their application requires changes or more information, they are

                            <li>Not all businesses are sent reminders of their impending renewal deadline.</li>
                            <li>Some businesses use OIA requests to gather the information they had sent last
                                year because they don’t keep a copy.</li>
                            <li>Some businesses forget (due to high HR churn) that they are accredited.</li>
