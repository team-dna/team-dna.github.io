          <p>We spoke with Steffan and Dean from Immigration NZ about the Employer Accreditation process,
            and discovered several pain points that affect both applicants and Immigration NZ.</p>
          <h4>Paper Based</h4>
          <p>Applications for Employer Accreditation are paper based. The paperwork must be transported
            by mail between the employer and different Government offices around the country, handed
            over to administration, and filed and ordered by staff. This results in unnecessary handling
            of applications before they’ve been reviewed. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="6u">
          <h4>Resource Required</h4>
          <p>The job of filling in an application or renewal is given to an HR employee, or sometimes a
            lawyer or consultant. It requires considerable time to complete and thus is an opportunity
            cost. This cost is a barrier to entry for many SMEs that would otherwise benefit from being
            accredited. </p>

          <h4>Errors</h4>
          <p>Many applications contain errors and must be returned (about 70% of first-time applications,
            and 30% of renewals), further adding to the resource cost and time delay.</p>

          <ul style="margin: 1em">
            <li>If their application requires changes or more information, they are only made aware of this
              when their application is returned by mail.</li>
            <li>Not all businesses are sent reminders of their impending renewal deadline.</li>
            <li>Some businesses use OIA requests to gather the information they had sent last year because
              they don’t keep a copy.</li>
            <li>Some businesses forget (due to high HR churn) that they are accredited.</li>
