							<p>We spoke with Steffan and Dean from Immigration NZ (INZ) about the Employer Accreditation process,
								and discovered several pain points that affect both applicants and INZ.</p>
							<h4>Paper Based</h4>
							<p>Applications for Employer Accreditation are paper based.
								The paperwork must be transported by mail between the employer and different govt
								offices around the country, handed over to administration, and filed and ordered by staff.
								This results in unnecessary handling of applications before they’ve been reviewed. </p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="6u">
								<h4>Resource Required</h4>
								<p>The application process takes time and effort. This means… and is a barrier to entry for many
									SMEs that would otherwise benefit from being accredited. Additionally, the renewal process is
									frustrating for accredited businesses, for the same reasons. </p>

								<h4>Errors</h4>
								<p>Further adding to the time cost and delay, many applications contain errors and must be returned
									(about 70% of first-time applications, and 30% of renewals).</p>

								</section>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="12u">
								<h4>Transparency</h4>
								<p>When an employer applies to be accredited, the status of their application is not visible to them.
									They do not know what information they need to update, if anything is incorrect in their initial application
									They have to resend the same information every year when they renew, because they don’t know what info already
									 exists in their file, rather than just telling INZ what’s changed</p>
